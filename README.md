## Sul sul! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the universe. I am a full-time tinkerer and a part-time artist. I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself, so you can find current projects I'm working on here. I am also really passionate about sustainability (in every aspect of the word). I like to create things that free up time and resources. More than anything, I love to work on projects with a heavy focus on empowerment. If you vibe with this, let's collaborate!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio website and a resource management app for the Sims
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning system design, React, and French
- âš¡ I'm a classically trained violist
