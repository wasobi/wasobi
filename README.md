## Sul sul! ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-time tinkerer, part-time artist, bonafide home cook, and an avid gamer. I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself, so you can find current projects I'm working on here. 

I like to create things that empower people, freeing up time and resources. If you vibe with this, we should chat about collaborating!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio website and a resource management app for the Sims
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning system design, React, and French
- âš¡ I'm a classically trained violist
